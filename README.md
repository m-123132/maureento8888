### Hello from Toronto! 🇨🇦

#### Frontend Dev & UX Designer 👩🏻‍💻

Hi there! I'm a [graduate student](https://kpe.utoronto.ca/academics-researchfuture-students/master-professional-kinesiology) from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca) in the day ☀️, and by night 🌃, I'm a frontend developer and UX designer. My tech interests are in patient care, health education, and accessibility.

All my repos are opensource, so feel free to check them out! Many of my projects have been made at different times and milestones of my career, so there may be issues or things that fall apart. I do check in when I have time to update them. I deeply love Vue.js, their philosophy, and its close-knit community. You might find me vibing at Vue.js conferences! (Vue.js Amsterdam 2020 💚)

In my free time, I enjoy reading, staying active, listening to podcasts, and fulfilling my foodie dreams.
