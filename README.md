### Hello from Tkaronto!

#### Frontend Dev & UX Designer 👩🏻‍💻

Hi there! I'm a student by  day ☀️, and a UX designer by night 🌃. My tech interests are **public health and equity**.

All my repos are opensource, so feel free to check them out! Many of my projects have been made at different times and milestones of my coding journey, so there may be issues or things that fall apart. I do check in when I have time to update them.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, staying active, listening to music, and tunneling down an interest rabbit hole.
